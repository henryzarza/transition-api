# Transition API with Astro

This is a project to test the web [Transition API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/) using the [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/).
The Last.fm API allows anyone to build their own programs using Last.fm data. Find out more about how you can plug directly into their vast database or browse the list of methods on [this documentation](https://www.last.fm/api#getting-started).

I also created [this small](https://mirror-maiasaura-9b2.notion.site/Tailwind-CSS-71b33a573fbf4859baeeaf9fe250168c?pvs=4) Tailwind CSS notes with my learning thoughts.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
